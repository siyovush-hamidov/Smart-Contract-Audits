# Smart Contract Audits 🛡️

This repository tracks my journey as a smart contract security researcher.  
Each entry corresponds to a contest or private audit I’ve participated in.

For every audit, I publish:
- A **formal report** (`/reports`) with structured vulnerability descriptions
- A **learning-focused article** on GitBook that reflects my research, process, and insights
